With dedicated portals for farmers, drivers, and admins, the system enables seamless fuel ordering, real-time tracking, and efficient delivery management. Farmers can easily place fuel orders, while drivers manage the received orders, and admins oversee operations for smooth execution. This system enhances accessibility, reduces delays, and ensures a reliable fuel supply for agricultural needs.</p>
